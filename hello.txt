Hi! I'm Do-Hyun, but my English name is Kyle so you can call me by my English name. I'm a freshman at LSA planning to major in data science and economics. A fun fact about myself is that I have a really big birthmark on my right hand. I'm really excited to join this club and hope to meet lots of good people:)
